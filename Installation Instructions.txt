Guidelines for Setting Up Java Detection Scripts

1. Choose a server for script installation.
2. On the chosen server, create two folders at these paths: C:\PowerShell\DetectJava\ and C:\PowerShell\DetectJava\Systems.
3. Transfer all scripts from this repository to C:\PowerShell\DetectJava.
4. Establish a network share pointing to C:\PowerShell\DetectJava. This can be either visible or hidden, depending on your preference.
5. Configure the network share to allow everyone Read/Write access.
    (a) Adjust security settings to grant either a specific service account or all users Read/Write permissions.
6. Run the following script on any target server or workstation to detect Java versions:

    Replace <SERVER_NAME> with the name of the server hosting the scripts.
    Replace <NETWORK_SHARE> with the name of the network share.

    Script commands:

        $serverName = "<SERVER_NAME>"
        $networkShare = "<NETWORK_SHARE>"

    Execute:

    Set execution policy to Unrestricted temporarily.
        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -force 

    Run the JavaDetect.ps1 script.
        powershell -executionpolicy bypass -file "\\" + $serverName + "\" + networkShare + "\JavaDetect.ps1"

    Revert execution policy to RemoteSigned.
        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -force


    Note: If your scripts are digitally signed, altering the execution policy isn't required.

7. For spreadsheet-formatted output, ensure both convert*.ps1 scripts are in the same directory as JavaDetect.ps1. Running these will generate an XLSX file report.
